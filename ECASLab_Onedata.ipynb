    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how to compute a simple climate indicator exploiting the features provided by the **ECAS** environment (in particular, those provided by the *Ophidia Framework*) and accessing input datafiles shared on the **Onedata** platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ENES Climate Analytics Service** (ECAS) is one of the *EOSC-Hub Thematic Services*. It builds on top of the Ophidia big data analytics framework with additional components and services from the INDIGO-DataCloud software stack, EUDAT and EGI e-infrastructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Onedata** (https://onedata.org/#/home) is a global data management system, providing easy access to distributed storage resources, supporting wide range of use cases from personal data management to data-intensive scientific computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this training notebook is to implement a real indicator from the *extreme climate indices* set directly on a shared and geographically distributed data collection exposed in the *Federated Data Archive* in a transparent way, without unnecessary data movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set comprises 27 indices based on daily temperatures or daily precipitation amount, defined with the purpose to analyze extreme events. In this training we are going to compute the *Summer Days index*: starting from the daily maximum temperature (2096-2100), the Summer Days index is the annual count of days where TX (daily maximum temperature) > 25°C.\n",
    "The full list of indices is provided here: [http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml](http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "The training session will be completely carried out in this Jupyter Notebook using python code and the set of modules and libraries available in the ECASlab; in particular, the calculation of the climate index will exploit a global data repository provided by the modelling groups and backed by computing centers and storage providers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the actual implementation of the indicator, let's understand the main features of Onedata, how data is organized and what are the key concepts behind its implementation.\n",
